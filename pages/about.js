					<h1>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</h1>
					<p>
						Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
						is an infectious disease caused
						by a newly discovered virus.
					</p>
					<p>
						The disease causes respiratory
						illness (like the flu) with
						symptoms such as a cough, fever,
						and in more severe cases,
						difficulty breathing. You can
						protect yourself by washing your
						hands frequently, avoiding
						touching your face, and avoiding
						close contact (1 meter or 3
						feet) with people who are
						unwell.
					</p>
					<h3>How it spreads</h3>
					<p>
						Coronavirus disease spreads
						primarily through contact with
						an infected person when they
						cough or sneeze. It also spreads
						when a person touches a surface
						or object that has the virus on
						it, then touches their eyes,
						nose, or mouth.
					</p>
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>The most common symptoms : </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Dry cough</li>
						<li>Fever</li>
						<li>Tiredness</li>
						<li>
							Difficulty breathing
							(severe cases)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Some people may have : </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Aches and pains</li>
						<li>Nasal congestion</li>
						<li>Running nose</li>
						<li>Sore throat</li>
						<li>Diarrhea</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These symptoms are usually mild
						and beging gradually. Some
						people become infected but don't
						develop any symptoms and don't
						feel unwell
					</p>
